# Day 25 Log

- Made a `Menubar` component and fixed the ui in a way it includes menu always.
- Polished the `MenuBar` component: added icons using `<img>` and styled them neatly.  
- Experimented with CSS variables and used `calc()` for positioning.  
- Did css work adding transtions, smooth seamless display when over on menu options.

- Fixed percentage rounding using `Math.round` for cleaner UI feedback.  
- Learned about reducing arrays with `.reduce()` and clarified how accumulators work.

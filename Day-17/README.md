# Day 17 Log

- Improved understanding of React state updates and immutability.
- Refactored toggle logic in the `togglePad` function to avoid direct state mutation.
- Learned how to properly use `map()` to update a specific object in an array.
- Used conditional rendering with `className` in JSX (`className={onOff ? "on" : undefined}`).
- Gained confidence with passing props and handling events in reusable components.

### Mood:

Got some good hands-on practice with updating React state from the parent component down to child components. It was fun!!

## Update 

I missed a day on **April 30, 2025** due to a wedding I had to attend, and I got a severe migraine so I wasnâ€™t able to study or code.

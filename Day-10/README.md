# Day 10 Log

- Learned about `useState` in React and how it works under the hood.  
- Understood the concept of **React state batching** and the difference between direct value updates and callback-based updates using `setState`.  
- Practiced updating state multiple times in a single function and observed how batching affects re-renders.  
- Also explored why inline styles in React use double curly braces `{{}}` and why styles are passed as objects.

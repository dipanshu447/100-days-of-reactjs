# Notes

- When we put a function in the `<form>` `action` attribute, it gives us a parameter which is a `FormData` object. We can use methods like `.get()` and `.entries()` on it to retrieve the form's data.
- Putting a function in the `<form>` `action` attribute works in a Vite project because Vite uses the latest ES6+ features and has a build step that handles JSX and JavaScript transformations.
- In a React CDN setup, there is no build step the code is directly shown to the browser. When the browser sees a function in the `action` attribute, it panics because it expects a URL, not a function.

## Why do radio buttons behave like single choice when they have the same name?

- In HTML, it's a rule that multiple radio elements with the same `name` attribute are grouped together.  
- When a user clicks on one option, it will select only that particular one in the group.  
- If they have different names, they will behave separately and allow multiple selections.

> **Note**: It works similarly for checkboxes, except checkboxes allow selecting multiple options even if they share the same name. To retrieve all selected checkbox values, use .getAll(), which returns an array containing all selected values.

## `<fieldset>`

- `<fieldset>` is an HTML tag used to group related form elements (like radios, checkboxes, inputs).
- It automatically draws a little border around its content like a small mini-box inside the form.
- It helps with both visual organization and accessibility (for screen readers etc).

### `<legend>`

- `<legend>` must be inside a `<fieldset>`.
- It gives a title to the group.
- The browser automatically places the text on the top border of the `<fieldset>`.

## How `Object.fromEntries()` works

- `Object.fromEntries()` is a method that takes an array (or array-like structure) of `[key, value]` pairs and converts it into a regular JavaScript object.

- `new FormData(form)`, it collects form fields as entries (each fieldâ€™s name and value).

- `Object.fromEntries(formData)` turns those entries directly into an object, where each form field becomes a property.

> Note : The only issue with this is that if there are multiple fields with the same name (like checkboxes), only the last value will be kept. To correctly collect all selected values (like from checkboxes), we should use `.getAll()` separately and update the object manually.

After using `Object.fromEntries(formData)`, we get an object like this:

```js
{
  email: "abc@example.com",
  password: "secret",
  options: "Full time"
}
```

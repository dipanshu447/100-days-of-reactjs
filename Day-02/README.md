# Day 2 Log

Today was all about getting comfortable with the React environment, JSX syntax, and creating reusable components.

- Gained a deeper understanding of the React environment setup.
- Learned how JSX works under the hood, it's JavaScript, not HTML.
- Understood what React components are and how they work.
- Built custom functional components of my own to structure the page.
- Practiced semantic structuring using HTML5 elements.

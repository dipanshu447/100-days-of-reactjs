# Day 33 Log

What I did today:

- Finalized the GitHub README and About section for FocusFlow
- Designed a professional LinkedIn post to showcase the project
- Learned how to structure project assets like favicons and videos in a Vite + React app
- Cleaned up folder structure and ensured everything is responsive and polished

What I learned:

- How to better present my work publicly (README, LinkedIn, GitHub profile)
- Importance of polish - even small UI touches make a big difference in how people perceive a project

FocusFlow now feels like a real, complete product. Super happy with todayâ€™s progress!

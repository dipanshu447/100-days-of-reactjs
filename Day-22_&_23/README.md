- Learned about `useRef()`:
  - Understood it retains values across renders without triggering re-renders.
  - Practiced accessing DOM elements via `ref={refVariable}`.
- Experimented with a counter using `useRef` and saw how it holds mutable values.
- Practiced working with input focus and reading DOM values directly.

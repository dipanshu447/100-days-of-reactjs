- Component re-renders can trigger side effects if not handled properly.
- Got Better understanding of derived state and render flow in React.
- Added **hint functionality** to the game to help users guess the word.
- Learnred and used `useMemo()` to select a few random characters from the current word as hints.
- Updated UI logic to reveal hints only when the game is lost or during gameplay.
- Applied red text color to unrevealed letters when the player loses using Tailwind and `clsx`.
- Practiced Using useMemo() to optimize derived data logic.

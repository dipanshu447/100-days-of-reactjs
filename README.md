# 100 Days of React

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey, where I’m fully committing to mastering React.js and its ecosystem! Over the next 100 days, I’ll be pushing my boundaries, diving deep into learning, building projects, and stepping outside my comfort zone. Each day is a new opportunity to challenge myself and grow as a developer, and I’m excited to see how far I can go.

This challenge isn’t just about coding it’s about consistency, growth, and constantly evolving. From basic React concepts to advanced features, I’ll be documenting my progress with code files, projects, and logs.

Rules for My 100 Days of Code Challenge:

1. **3 Hours a Day** - Commit to at least 3 hours of coding every day, no matter what.
2. **No Backing Out** - This challenge is a promise to myself — no excuses.
3. **Build, Don’t Just Learn** - Focus on building projects, not just consuming tutorials.
4. **Grouped Updates** - I’ll post updates every 5–7 days, so I can focus on learning, not posting.

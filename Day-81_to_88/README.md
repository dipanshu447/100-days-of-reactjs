# Day 81-88 log

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been fully focused on building and polishing my new CLI tool: [build-discord-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/build-discord-app)

Here’s what I worked on between Day 81 and Day 88:
- Created clean, production-ready templates for Discord bots
- Built the CLI core logic using Node.js and ES Modules
- Integrated Clack.js for beautiful, interactive prompts
- Used Degit to fetch GitHub-hosted templates
- Implemented smart conflict resolution for folders and files
- Added helpful flags like --yes, --pkgname, and --lang
- Refined README.md, added badges, usage docs
- Published the template repo: discord-app-templates
- Packaged & published to npm (npx build-discord-app)

This mini-project has taught me a ton:
- CLI UX & flow design
- Advanced prompt handling with Clack
- Node.js file operations and error handling
- Publishing CLI tools with npm
- Writing meaningful documentation and guiding users through the DX

I'm truly proud of this one.
It’s simple, powerful, and makes setting up a Discord bot feel effortless.

Try it out:

```bash
npx build-discord-app
```
